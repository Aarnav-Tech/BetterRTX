---

## Installation

1. Download the repository or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarnav-Tech/BetterRTX.git
cd BetterRTX
```
2. For local install make sure that the script is in the folder of the shader present.
   
3.  I recommend local install as the one online the links are broken and doesnt work sometimes.

4. Run Powershell (in the same directory as your script) as Administrator and paste:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass
.\BetterRTX_Installer_MGCEdit.ps1
```
5. Follow on screen prompts. (Preview version not recommended though.)

## Uninstallation
Run:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass
.\BetterRTX_Installer_MGCEdit.ps1
```
And choose uninstall after first screen.
